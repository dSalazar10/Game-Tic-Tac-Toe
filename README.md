I was asked by a friend to tutor them in their intro to C++ class assignment. So inorder to best help them, I tried to doo the assignment on my own. I played a couple games on the whiteboard and made a flowchart based on the game. Based on that I designed this code and kept it a secret. I walked them through the exact same process, but I let them do the work, helping them if they had any issues. After they informed me of how well they did, I posted it here as a reference.
